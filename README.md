# Where do healthy people live in the US?
An analysis of population health at the county level across the US.

"Understanding key factors correlating with positive health outcomes is important for driving public health policy. Here, we examine factors such as income, access to food (both "healthy" and "unhealthy" options), and access to recreational space and their relationship with health indicators such as diabetes rate, heart disease mortality, and life expectancy on the county level. We will also look for signs of racial/ethnic bias in access to health while controlling for potential differences in income. Our findings could function as an initial step towards government funding for public recreational areas, local farmers and markets, and/or grocery stores in counties lacking access."
