Metadata Updated: April 21, 2022

This dataset includes estimates of U.S. life expectancy at birth by state and census tract for the period 2010-2015 (1).

Estimates were produced for 65,662 census tracts,
covering the District of Columbia (D.C.) and all states, excluding Maine and Wisconsin,
representing 88.7% of all U.S. census tracts (see notes).

These estimates are the result of the collaborative project,
“U.S. Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project (USALEEP),”
between the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS),
and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) (2).
